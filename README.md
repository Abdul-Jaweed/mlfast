This Python machine learning package is built on top of scikit-learn and provides a simple API for regression and classification modeling. The main function in this package is called Regression() and Classification() which takes in the following arguments:

- `X`: The independent variables (features) of the data set
- `y`: The dependent variable (target) of the data set
- `model`: The name of the regression and classification algorithm to be used (e.g. `lr` for Linear Regression, or `rf` for Random Forest Classifier, etc.)
- `scaler`: The name of the data scaler to be used (e.g. "standard" for StandardScaler, "robust" for RobustScaler, etc.)
- `cat`: A boolean indicating [`True` or `False`] whether the data set has categorical variables that need to be one-hot encoded.
